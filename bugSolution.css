The error lies in the calculation for the width of the element.  Spaces are missing between the `+` operator and its operands, and units are not consistent.

**Incorrect CSS (`bug.css`):**
```css
#myElement { width:calc(100px+20%); }
```

**Corrected CSS (`bugSolution.css`):**
```css
#myElement { width: calc(100px + 20%); }
```
This corrected version includes the necessary spaces around the `+` operator.  Ensure units are consistent throughout the calculation (px, %, em, etc.) to avoid unexpected results.
